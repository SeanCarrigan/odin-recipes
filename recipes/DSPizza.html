    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine ingredients into a medium bowl and stir with sturdy spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once it comes together, use a wet hand to give the dough a series of
        20-30 slap and folds as shown in the video. You can also use a stand
        mixer with a dough hook if preferred.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover bowl with plastic and let it sit in warm spot for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 30 min, build more strength into the dough by grabbing an of
        dough, stretching it out, and folding back over. Rotate the dough 45-90
        degreed and repeat 5-6 more times see video for technique.
      </li>
      <li>
        After these stretch and folds, tuck and fold the dough a few more times
        as shown in the video to shape and stretch the dough into a taught ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap bowl with plastic and set in warm place for 2 hours. After the 2
        hours dough should have doubled in size, be buoyant, and slightly bounce
        back when poked.

      <li>Lay half of the dough into each pan and gently press to spread.</li>
      <li>Cover pans and allow dough to relax for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        After the 30 minutes, gently stretch and press dough to cover the bottom
        of the pans.
